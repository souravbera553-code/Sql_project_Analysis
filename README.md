# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `sql_project_p1`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sql_project_p1;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **What is the total sales and number of orders for each product category?**:
```SELECT  
    Category,                         
    SUM(total_sale) AS Total_sale,    
    COUNT(transactions_id) AS no_of_order 
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY Category;
```

2. **What is the monthly sales trend across all years?**:
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(sale_date) AS sales_year,
    MONTHNAME(sale_date) AS Sales_month,
    SUM(total_sale) AS Total_sale
FROM
    retail_sales
GROUP BY 1 , 2
ORDER BY 1,Total_sale  desc ;
```

3. **Which month had the highest sales in each year?**:
```sql
SELECT sale_year, sale_month, total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT 
        YEAR(sale_date) AS sale_year,
        MONTHNAME(sale_date) AS sale_month,
        SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(sale_date) ORDER BY SUM(total_sale) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTHNAME(sale_date)
) t
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

4. **What is the average age of customers in each product category?**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category, ROUND(AVG(age), 0) AS Avarage_age
FROM
    retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

5. **How do sales and order counts differ between male and female customers?**:
```sql
SELECT 
    gender, SUM(total_sale) AS Total_sales,
    count(transactions_id) as Total_order
    FROM
    retail_sales
GROUP BY gender;
```

6. **Who are the top 5 customers based on their total spending?**:
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS Total_Spending
FROM
    retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
order by Total_Spending desc
limit 5 ;
```

7. **How are sales distributed across different shifts of the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)?**:
```sql
select 
case 
when hour(sale_time)<12 then " Morning shift" 
when hour (sale_time) between 12 and 17 then "Afternoon shift"
else " Evening shift" 
End as Shift_time , 
COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_transactions,
sum(total_sale) as Sales 
from retail_sales 
group by Shift_time;
```

8. **What is the total profit (Sales â€“ COGS) generated by each category?**:
```sql
SELECT 
    Category,
    ROUND(SUM(Total_sale) - SUM(cogs), 2) AS Total_profit
FROM
    retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

9. **What is the average transaction value across all sales?**:
```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(total_sale),2) AS avg_transaction_value
FROM retail_sales;
```

10. **What is the year-over-year sales growth percentage?**:
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(sale_date) AS year,
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales,
    LAG(SUM(total_sale)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(sale_date)) AS prev_year_sales,
    ROUND(
        (SUM(total_sale) - LAG(SUM(total_sale)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(sale_date))) 
        / LAG(SUM(total_sale)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(sale_date)) * 100, 2
    ) AS sales_growth_percent
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date)
ORDER BY year;
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.
